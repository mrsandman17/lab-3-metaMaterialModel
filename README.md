# lab3-metaMaterial-model
Simulates a MetaMaterial with ABCD matrices. 
The material consists of a number of cells. A single cell of the cirucit is described by the diagram below.
A different simulation can be created instead of a metaMaterial, by building different waveguide circuits. The circuits can be created using the different components.
